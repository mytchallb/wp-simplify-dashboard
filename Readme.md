# WP Plugin: Simplify Dashboard

"Simplify Dashboard" adds a toggle in the admin bar to hide menu items you don't use much.

It gives you a simple interface for your users, and can be quickly turned on or off.

Choose which items are hidden in the Settings>Simplify Dashboard page by writing their menu name, or specify the actual HTML id.
